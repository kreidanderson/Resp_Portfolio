# Resp_Portfolio
This is project has 3 html files and 3 css files respectively. 
index.html is linked to index.css
portfolio.html is linked to portfolio.css
contact.html is linked to contact.html

The first goal of this project was to effectively use a bootstap provided navbar and make sure it is functioning.
After that it was important that all of the pages (see above) properly linked to each other. 
Finally, design was key especially making sure that each page responded appropriately on major devices.

It's not perfect but it gets you from point a to point b. 
Enjoy!
